<text> In some cases two, or more, rates must be found to get the n in terms of the eiven variable. </text>
<list> e.g. (i) A spherical balloon is being deflated so that the radius  decreases at a constant rate of 10 mm/s.  Calculate the rate of change of volume when the radius of the  balloon is 100 mm. </list>
<equation> There is an equation </equation>
<text> ..when the radius is 100mm, the volume is decreasing at a rate of 4000007mm3/s /s </text>
