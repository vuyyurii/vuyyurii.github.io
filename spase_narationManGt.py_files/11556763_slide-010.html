[heading] Rates of Change  [/heading]
[text] In some cases two, or more, rates must be found to get the n in terms of the eiven variable. [/text]
[list] e.g. (i) A spherical balloon is being deflated so that the radius  decreases at a constant rate of 10 mm/s.  Calculate the rate of change of volume when the radius of the  balloon is 100 mm. [/list]
[equation] There is an equation [/equation]
[text] ..when the radius is 100mm, the volume is decreasing at a rate of 4000007mm3/s /s [/text]
