[text] Translations y = f(x-a)+b The role of parameter a: a ] 0 the graph shifts right a units. - the x-coordinates are increased a units 
a [ 0 the graph shifts left a units. - the x-coordinates are decreased a units.  
WARNING: watch the sign of a  
The role of parameter b: b ] 0 the graph shifts up b units. - the y-coordinates are increased b ; units.  
b [0 the graph shifts down b units. - the y-coordinates are decreased b units [/text]
